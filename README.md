*Technologies Used*

*Unsolved Problems*

1. The project needs big improvements on style and formatting.

3. Attach book cover images from OpenLibrary API

*Planning Process*

I originally chose a different idea, but decided to narrow my scope and keep it simple because of the project timeline.

I used the suggested schedule for the project, which was very helpful.
