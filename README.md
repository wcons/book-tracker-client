*Application Description*

This application allows a user to keep track of their own list of books.

The user can log in to their account and enter, edit and remove books from a database.  The user can enter the title, author, and year of publication for a book, and can view their list of books.

This repository contains the front-end code for the UI portion of the application.

The back-end code can be viewed (here)[https://github.com/wcons/book-tracker-rails-api]

*Technologies Used*

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

*Unsolved Problems*

1. The project needs big improvements on style and formatting.
2. Implement a modal for pop-up form fields
3. Attach book cover images from OpenLibrary API

*Planning Process*

I originally chose a different idea, but decided to narrow my scope and keep it simple because of the project timeline.

I used the suggested schedule for the project, which was very helpful.
